# 疑问点
## chapter 1
### 这个句子的主谓宾是？the longer time后面是属于什么？
I am not sure how many times I have answered that question or even
how many different versions I have given, but the answer keeps evolving
the longer time I spend at Google and the more I learn about the nuances of
our various testing practices.

### crack是什么意思？机会？裂缝？
There were many others who preceded me at Google and I
wanted to give them a crack at writing it first.

### directs是下属的意思？
My second problem was that
I as test director for Chrome and Chrome OS (a position now occupied by
one of my former directs) had insights into only a slice of the Google testing
solution.

### I wish I had not waited so long to write it.的意思是“希望没有托太长的时间”还是“真希望我本没有等待这么长的时间来写它，表示实际上已经等了很长的时间”
Six months later, the book was done and I wish I had not
waited so long to write it.

### improved upon中upon的作用是?
Techniques proven ineffective at
former employers were either abandoned or improved upon by Google’s
culture of innovation.

### once在这里的作用是？
Google testers are
willing to try anything once but are quick to abandon techniques that do
not prove useful.

### 为什么不是with each other？
At times, testing is interwoven with development to the point that the two
practices are indistinguishable from each other, and at other times, it is so
completely independent that developers aren’t even aware it is going on.

### all this despite中this的意思是?
We
can nearly produce an operating system within the boundaries of a single
calendar year; we release client applications such as Chrome every few weeks;
and web applications change daily—all this despite the fact that our start-up
credentials have long ago expired.

###  对于do exactly that，为什么不是exactly do that或do that exactly?
In this environment, it is almost easier to
describe what testing is not—dogmatic, process-heavy, labor-intensive, and
time-consuming—than what it is, although this book is an attempt to do
exactly that.

### out there的意思是？
The size and complexity of Google’s software
testing problem are as large as any company’s out there.

### industry vertical的意思是？
From client operating
systems, to web apps, to mobile, to enterprise, to commerce and social,
Google operates in pretty much every industry vertical.

### lots of it的意思是？
Our software is big;
it’s complex; it has hundreds of millions of users; it’s a target for hackers;
much of our source code is open to external scrutiny; lots of it is legacy; we
face regulatory reviews; our code runs in hundreds of countries and in many
different languages, and on top of this, users expect software from Google to
be simple to use and to “just work.”

### parts 可数？
Perhaps there are parts of it that will
work in other organizations. 

### parcel为什么没有冠词？
Test isn’t a separate practice; it’s part and parcel of the development
process itself.

### escalation的真实意思
If a
product breaks in the field, the first point of escalation is the developer who
created the problem, not the tester who didn’t catch it.

### you build it, you break it的意思是？
In order for the “you build it, you break it” motto to be real (and kept real
over time), there are roles beyond the traditional feature developer that are
necessary.

### there的作用是？
Testers
are there to make developers more productive and a large part of that productivity
is avoiding re-work because of sloppy development.

### push toward release intensifies的主谓宾（推进产品发布）
They also organize the testing work of SWEs and
SETs, interpret test results, and drive test execution, particularly in the late
stages of a project as the push toward release intensifies.

### in isolation如何翻译？
From a quality standpoint, SWEs own features and the quality of those
features in isolation.

### is secure主谓宾是？
When such bugs are rare, TEs can turn to the primary task
of ensuring that the software runs common user scenarios, meets performance
expectations, is secure, internationalized, accessible, and so on.
