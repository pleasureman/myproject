# 疑问点
## chapter 1
### 这个句子的主谓宾是？the longer time后面是属于什么？
I am not sure how many times I have answered that question or even
how many different versions I have given, but the answer keeps evolving
the longer time I spend at Google and the more I learn about the nuances of
our various testing practices.

### crack是什么意思？机会？裂缝？
There were many others who preceded me at Google and I
wanted to give them a crack at writing it first.

### directs是下属的意思？
My second problem was that
I as test director for Chrome and Chrome OS (a position now occupied by
one of my former directs) had insights into only a slice of the Google testing
solution.
