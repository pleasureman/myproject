Again thank you to Mark. Thank you to the dockercon organizers. Thank you to my team who is here some of them are sitting in front. I might be the one on stage but certainly everything that i'm going to talk about during this talk is the result of a group effort and I'm really proud of the way that we all work together.

So thank you so much and I have some former co-workers here as well so I'm feeling the love. My name is Laura again, a senior engineer at codeship and for the next 45 minutes prepare to have your mind blown. We're going to talk about parallel testing with docker.

So at codeship if you're not familiar with us, with CI and CD accompany we focus on automating your tests and your deployment so that you can spend more time focusing on writing code and less time worrying about messing with servers and production.

Aside from that I'm a docker captain and you may have heard some docker captain charter. Maybe even met some mysterious creatures called docker captains. So we are meant to be kind of representation of the docker community. Lots of us have been working with docker for a very very long time.

If you are a newbie to docker. We would love to talk to you any questions that you have. No question is too simple and so please find us. A lot of us are wearing black hoodies that have little darker seagulls on them that's the captain marker. So feel free to say hi to us.

Before I was that coach, I worked for a really small research and development company. Our research and development team are part of the Century Link which some of you might know is a big telco provider and they wanted to have some senior engineers working on really cool projects.
