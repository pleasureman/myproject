Again thank you to Mark. Thank you to the dockercon organizers. Thank you to my team who is here some of them are sitting in front. I might be the one on stage but certainly everything that i'm going to talk about during this talk is the result of a group effort and I'm really proud of the way that we all work together.

So thank you so much and I have some former co-workers here as well so I'm feeling the love. My name is Laura again. I'm a senior engineer at codeship and for the next 45 minutes prepare to have your mind blown. We're going to talk about parallel testing with docker.

So at codeship if you're not familiar with us, with CI and CD accompany we focus on automating your tests and your deployment so that you can spend more time focusing on writing code and less time worrying about messing with servers and production.
